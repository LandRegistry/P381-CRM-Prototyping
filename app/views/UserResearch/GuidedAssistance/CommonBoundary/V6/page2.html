        <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/how-to-resolve-neighbour-disputes/talk-to-your-neighbour" target="_blank">Talking to your neighbour</a> with a view to reaching an amicable agreement is usually the preferred thing to do. If you are unable to resolve a problem via an informal discussion, then you may wish to consider the possibility of entering into a formal boundary agreement with them about the position of the boundary or who is responsible for its maintenance. Land Registry can then note the agreement on the individual registers.</p>

        <p>Another potentially complex and costly option, particularly if agreement cannot be reached with your neighbour beforehand, is a process called 'determining the boundary', but it should not be thought of as a means to resolve a dispute.</p>
         
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-6">The Land Registry cannot help you</h3>
        
        <ul class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-5">  
            <li>resolve or become involved in a boundary dispute</li>
            <li>enforce the contents of the register</li>
            <li>make someone comply with any covenants referred to on the register, for example, rebuild a wall</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Ultimately, only the court or the Land Registration division of the Property Chamber can determine the exact position of a boundary or other disputed issue.</p>

        <p>If a property is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-information-about-property-and-land/search-the-index-map" target="_blank">registered</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-information-about-property-and-land/search-the-register" target="_blank">check the registers or associated deeds</a> as they may contain information about who owns the boundaries or who is responsible for their maintenance.</p>

        <p>Most registers and deeds do not contain anything specific. Even if they do, they may be out of date because of acts or agreements made between previous owners that we're unaware of.</p>
            
        <p>If the property is not registered, we will not hold any information. You'll need to find and read your title deeds independently. Have a look at any documents your solicitor may have given to you when you bought your property to see if they mention anything about boundary features.</p>
            
        <p>We do not provide legal advice and we cannot give out information about your title deeds over the telephone.</p>

                    <p>A 'T' mark is the most common boundary mark on deed plans. The 'T' mark normally extends into the property which owns the boundary feature or who is responsible for its maintenance. Always read the wording in the deed to make sure this is the case.</p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">'T' marks that appear in the deed but not on the title plan</h3>
                        
                        <p>We rarely add 'T' marks to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/land-registry-plans-title-plan" target="_blank">title plan</a>. Instead we add a note to the register. For example, "The 'T' mark referred to affects the northern boundary of the land in this title." Sometimes the boundary may be referred to in the wording of the deed without using a 'T' mark.</p>

                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">T marks that appear in the deed plan but not in the deed</h3>

      </div>

        <p>We cannot tell you the precise location of a property boundary. Land in England and Wales is registered with what are known as general boundaries.</p>

        <p>A red line on the HM Land Registry <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/land-registry-plans-title-plan/land-registry-plans-title-plan-practice-guide-40-supplement-5" target="_blank">title plan</a> shows the general boundary, not the exact legal position of the boundary. These lines show the general location of the property in relation to physical features on the ground such as walls, hedges, rivers and roads as marked on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ordnance-survey" target="_blank">Ordnance Survey</a> map.</p>
            
        <p>The legal boundary may or may not be somewhere within that feature or along one side of it. For most people, the general boundary rule meets their needs.</p>

                    <p>The title deeds rarely identify precise legal boundaries and it is not usually necessary to have these recorded anywhere. As such, when a property is first registered, it's not practical to try to define where the legal boundaries may lie - it is expensive and can lead to unnecessary disputes. The lines on the title plan show the general location of the property based on our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/land-registry-plans-title-plan" target="_blank">reasonable interpretation</a> of the deeds.</p>

                    <p>Documents rarely contain sufficient descriptions to establish the precise position of a boundary. In such cases legal presumptions relating to certain types of boundary feature may be helpful. As registration with general boundaries leaves the exact line of the boundary undetermined, a decision upon a boundary can draw upon any facts, logic, established laws or reasoning relating to a boundary feature and the effect of a legal presumption may be carried forward into a registered title.</p>

                        <p>Other available evidence, such as a declaration as to the position or ownership of a boundary, may make it difficult for the court to decide based upon legal presumption.</p>

        <p>Write to us if you think the title plan for your land or property is wrong.</p>

        <p>Before you contact us you should be aware that the Land Registration Rules 2003 make no provision for the replacement of title plans when the physical layout of the site has changed.</p>
            
        <p>Title plans are prepared using the latest Ordnance Survey map published at the time of first registration and, generally, once a title plan has been prepared it will not be replaced. For example, we will not update a title plan solely on the basis that later Ordnance Survey information has been made available, or if land has been removed from the title. As such, later editions of the map may show the same feature in a slightly different place, without this necessarily having any significance in terms of the movement of physical features on the ground.</p>
            
        <p>If you still think the title plan for your land or property is wrong, you'll need to describe the error and include an Ordnance Survey plan and any other supporting material, for example, certified copies of the property deeds.</p>
            
        <p>We'll look into the matter. If we find that there's a mistake, we'll explain how it happened and how to put it right. If we do not think there's a mistake, we'll tell you why.</p>
