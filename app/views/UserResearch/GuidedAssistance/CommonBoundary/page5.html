        <p>Most registers and deeds do not contain anything specific. Even if they do, they may be out of date because of acts or agreements made between previous owners that we're unaware of.</p>
            
        <p>If the property is not registered, we will not hold any information. You'll need to find and read your title deeds independently.

        <p>We cannot tell you the precise location of a property boundary. Land in England and Wales is registered with what are known as general boundaries.</p>

        <p>A red line on the HM Land Registry <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/land-registry-plans-title-plan/land-registry-plans-title-plan-practice-guide-40-supplement-5" target="_blank">title plan</a> shows the general boundary, not the exact legal position of the boundary. These lines show the general location of the property in relation to physical features on the ground such as walls, hedges, rivers and roads as marked on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ordnance-survey" target="_blank">Ordnance Survey</a> map.</p>
            
        <p>The legal boundary may or may not be somewhere within that feature or along one side of it. For most people, the general boundary rule meets their needs.</p>

        <p>Write to us if you think the title plan for your land or property is wrong.</p>

        <p>Before you contact us you should be aware that the Land Registration Rules 2003 make no provision for the replacement of title plans when the physical layout of the site has changed.</p>
            
        <p>Title plans are prepared using the latest Ordnance Survey map published at the time of first registration and, generally, once a title plan has been prepared it will not be replaced. For example, we will not update a title plan solely on the basis that later Ordnance Survey information has been made available, or if land has been removed from the title. As such, later editions of the map may show the same feature in a slightly different place, without this necessarily having any significance in terms of the movement of physical features on the ground.</p>
            
        <p>If you still think the title plan for your land or property is wrong, you'll need to describe the error and include an Ordnance Survey plan and any other supporting material, for example, certified copies of the property deeds.</p>
            
        <p>We'll look into the matter. If we find that there's a mistake, we'll explain how it happened and how to put it right. If we do not think there's a mistake, we'll tell you why.</p>
