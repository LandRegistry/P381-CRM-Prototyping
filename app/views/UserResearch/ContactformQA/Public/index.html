However, there are a number of circumstances where we cannot offer an extension, the most commonly encountered include where:</p>

              <ul class="govuk-body">
              <li>the relevant rule under the Land Registration Rules 2003 prescribes a period or a maximum period and whilst this maximum period itself cannot be extended, we may be able to delay determining the application concerned to allow for late responses. An example of where we could do this would be to allow for a late objection to an application for the entry of a restriction (s.45(2) and r.92(9)).</li>
              
              <li>the registrar serves notice of an application to cancel a caution against first registration (s.18(4) and r.53) or to cancel a unilateral notice (s.36(3) and r.86) on the expiry of the prescribed period, which cannot be extended beyond a maximum number of days, the registrar is obliged to cancel the caution or unilateral notice in the absence of an objection.</li> 
              
              <li>The period for serving counter notice to an application for registration as proprietor by a squatter under Schedule 6 to the LRA 2002 cannot be extended (para.3 of Sch.6 and r.189). Counter-notice is ineffective once the notice period has expired: paragraphs 3(2) and 4 of Schedule 6.  Rule 189 deals with the notice period for giving counter-notice: no provision is made for the period to be extended.</li></ul>

            <p class='govuk-body'>From 18 March 2020 we <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/coronavirus-covid-19-impact-on-our-services" target="_blank">temporarily suspended our service that allows customers to make appointments to visit HM Land Registry in person.</a> <br>
              <br>
             Customers can no longer visit one of our offices to have their identity verified or submit an application for registration with us in person. We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience this causes. We are following current government guidance on slowing the further spread of COVID-19 and will update our GOV.UK pages once the service is available again.  <br>
              <br>
             Customers who were planning to visit one of our offices to have their identity verified using Form ID1, or Form ID2, and personally submit an application for registration with us will temporarily be unable to do so. We advise that you thoroughly check that you need to include an ID1 form with your application. You can have your identity verified and the form signed by any of the professionals listed on Form ID1, if available.<br>
             <br>
             From Monday 4th May we have made some temporary changes to make it easier to have your identity verified. This includes extending the professions of people who can verify identity and allowing verification to be carried out by video call where certain conditions are met.<br>
             <br>
             Further details on these changes are available in our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/temporary-changes-to-hm-land-registrys-evidence-of-identity-requirements-pg67a" target="_blank">new practice guide 67A: temporary changes to HM Land Registry’s evidence of identity requirements.</a> <br>
             <br>
             On 26th May minor amendments to practice guide 67A were made as a result of customer feedback. Some changes have also been made to the evidence of identity forms referred to in the guide, in particular to forms ID1, ID2 and ID5 in relation to verification by way of a video call.<br>
             <br>
             Applications can still be submitted by post to: HM Land Registry Citizen Centre 
             PO Box 74 
             Gloucester GL14 9BB <br>
             <br>
             In the meantime, we are conscious of the difficulties in obtaining identity verification in the current circumstances. So, we have decided to stop rejecting applications where evidence or confirmation of identity is completely missing until further notice. We expect customers, however, to complete applications as correctly and as fully as possible. We will be raising a requisition where the information is missing or insufficient</p>

              <br>
              This means that, for land registration purposes, a signature page will need to be signed in pen and witnessed in person (not by a video call). The signature will then need to be captured, with a scanner or a camera, to produce a PDF, JPEG or other suitable copy of the signed signature page. Each party sends a single email to their conveyancer to which is attached the final agreed copy of the document and the copy of the signed signature page.<br>
